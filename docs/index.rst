AlertOps Announces Playbook Automation Focusing on Critical Enterprise Needs in Fast-growing Incident Response Market
========

CHICAGO, Oct. 9, 2018 /PRNewswire/ — Illinois-based digital operations management and real-time collaboration platform AlertOps, announces a renewed focus on Enterprises in the IT Operations Management, DevOps, and SecOps spaces. CIOs and IT leaders need vendors that can merge technology and business scenarios to solve complex collaboration and communication problems. AlertOps’ roadmap reveals disruptive features that deliver on the biggest communication challenges that enterprises face when handling Major IT incidents with Playbook Automation.

A Hyper-growth Market
====
The incident response market is expanding rapidly with new organizations migrating to the cloud each year, and others taking on new use-cases to protect business-critical services. “This space is increasingly competitive,” says Robert Crum, Vice President of Technology at AlertOps, “with recent acquisitions from companies like Atlassian which acquired OpsGenie for $295 Million, and Splunk which grabbed VictorOps for $120 Million, companies want to stay strategically relevant and exploit new business models, and are investing heavily in this area.”

According to Markets and Markets, the incident response market is expected to grow from USD 13.38 billion in 2018 to USD 33.76 billion by 2023. Major reasons for growth are increased enterprise security breaches, heavy financial losses, and additional compliance requirements – like GDPR.

The Stakes for Enterprise are Higher than Ever
====
A recent interview by ITIC reported that for 33% of enterprises, just one hour of downtime costs their organization between $1 million and $5 million. Additionally, the Ponemon Institute, found that less than half of top executives are informed about an organization’s response process, yet 79% of executives say executive-level involvement is necessary to achieve effective incident response. Teams across an organization need a solution that helps them respond dynamically to situations, so they can make better decisions for the business in real time.

Playbook Automation Enables Organizations to Respond Quickly at Scale
====
AlertOps Playbook Automation allows organizations to implement a well-thought-out plan with automated processes and escalations in place ensuring digital operations teams, management, business partners, and customers are all empowered as part of the solution when responding to major incidents.

    Flexible – provides advanced flexibility and granularity that Enterprises need when responding to major incidents.
    Proactive – provides a configurable pre-built Incident Response Playbook template, ensuring all key people and teams are sent relevant, timely and unique alerts.
    Advanced — an Open API delivers unparalleled access and connections to hundreds of integrations, while simultaneously giving technical teams the granularity they need to build powerful automations.
